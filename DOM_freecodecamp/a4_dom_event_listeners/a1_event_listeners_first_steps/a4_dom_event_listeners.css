/*
I want to build three boxes that are positioned in the
middle of the page.
To achieve this, I make the body the first flex-container.
We need to set the hight to 100vh to occupy the whole page as
flex body.
To center the child container to the flex body parent.
We use following proporties on the parent:
justify-content: center; --> horizontally centering
align-items: center --> vertically centering of child

Now we create a box with an overall margin of 10px that will give
us a margin to the container and also a margin between the boxes.
given we will create 3 of them.

The container we will prepare for the three boxes. Will have
the attribute justfy-content: space-between;
This will space the boxes evenly within the container.
The container will have tha attribute display:flex;
Preparing it to place the boxes (his children) properly.

Furthermore the boxes will also have the attribute display: flex;
That will allow us to properly handle the Text in the boxes.
We prepare for the children of the box (button and header) to be placed
vertically in the box. We use flex-direction: column;
